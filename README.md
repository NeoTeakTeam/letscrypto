# Let's crypto

Let's encrypt together!

## Info

This is a simple encryption and decryption program. We have created some tools to use it.

We have developed a console program with full platform support and a graphical decryption tool that supports only Windows.

On the first day of working on this project, I set a goal. Strive to complete all the projects within a day.

Eventually, we finished everything around 2/9/2025 18:30(f5738c52ad54f926e1cfaf01ae9e0de4f02d57a1).

## Install

First, you need to clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NeoTeakTeam/letscrypto.git
```

And ensure that you have version 9.0 or above of dotnet.

Then, you can proceed to the corresponding project for compilation.

```bash
# Console
cd letscrypto/letscrypto-cli-all
dotnet build

# GUI (windows only)
cd letscrypto/letscrypto-gui-windows
dotnet build
```

Finally, you have completed it.

## Usage

It is actually very simple to use these tools; you just need to open these programs.
